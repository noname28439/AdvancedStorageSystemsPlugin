# AdvancedStorageSystems Plugin
This plugin just adds a container to store tons of Items inside of a simple disc to prevent players from having to build huge storage halls filled with chests to store their property.
Thie discs can be put into dispensers and the intems inside can then be accessed by an extraction and insertion interface.

(For those of you who know the Applied Energystics Mod: It works similar to the ME-System)

## Crafting a storagedisc
You can use the following crafting recipe to gain storagediscs.<br>

<br>(You can also obtain this item from the creative inventory, because it is just a DISC_PIGSTEP item)

## Building the System
- place a dispenser and put a storage disc inside
- click a sign attacked to the dispenser to open the extraction menu
- click an iron trapdoor on top of the dispenser to open the insertion inventory
- click a tripwirehook attatched to the dispenser with a storagedisc in hand to duplicate the storagedisc inside the dispenser

(The functions won't work if there is no storagedisc inside of the dispenser)

## Insert / Extract items
- To insert items, just place a hopper next to the StorageSystem base block and it will suck in the hoppers items.
- To extract items from the StorageSystem place a dropper under the base block and place the item you want to extract in the middle of the dropper inventory. Then power the dropper and it will throw out the item if the storagesystem currently holds it.


## Installation
- Download the AdvancedStorageSystems.jar
- Copy it into the plugins folder of your Minecraft server
